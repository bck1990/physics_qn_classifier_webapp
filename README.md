This is a fun hobby project. It is a Python Flask webapp with trained AI model to classify H2 A Level physics questions into their respective topics.

Machine learning is trained separately in Python using many physics practice questions and the classifier model is imported in the .pkl file. tfidf vectorizer used to vectorized the words is also imported in .pkl.

Deployed live on https://physicsquestion.herokuapp.com/

Feel free to try it out! You can enter questions or phrases like like "find the speed of ball..." or "an alpha particle..."
